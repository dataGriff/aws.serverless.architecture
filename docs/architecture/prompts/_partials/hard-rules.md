## Hard rules

- Everything in an account is generated from the catalog. Never hand-edit a rule, bucket, route, role, alarm or contract; change the catalog or the generator.
- Do not introduce Athena, Glue, Iceberg, Kinesis, Temporal, Step Functions outside the saga module, a central gateway, CloudFront, a Schema Registry or a data platform account. If you believe an ADR trigger has fired, stop and run `prompts/10-evaluate-a-trigger.md` instead.
- PII: every schema field carries `x-pii`. `indirect` travels in clear, `direct` is encrypted per subject in public events through the subject-key service, `special` never enters an event.
- Facts are events. One synchronous hop between domains, through a generated client. Never another domain's database or bucket.
- Tests before infrastructure: L0 contract (no infra) → L1 domain-local (LocalStack + pinned `platform-local`) → L2 platform. Never depend on another domain's code or a shared environment.
- Small commits with the ADR or doc section they implement named in the message. If a decision cannot be undone and the docs do not settle it, stop and ask, giving the options and your recommendation.
